# hedy-haskell

[Hedy](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy) is a gradual programming language by @felienne.

I needed an excuse to mess around with [Megaparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec), a monadic parser combinator library, so I made this.

Install [Stack](https://haskellstack.org) and run

```bash
stack test
stack run 1 samples/level1.txt
stack run 2 samples/level2.txt 
# etc
```
